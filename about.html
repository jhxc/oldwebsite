         <p>Welcome to my website! </p>
          <p>
           I am a third year Mechatronics Systems student at the University of Melbourne.  
           I'm especially interested in control theory and optimisation, and in particular, their applications toward robotics, automation and scripting.
           Over the past few years, I have developed a variety of automation scripts such as a social media management bot and a linguistic gloss formatter (LateX).
         </p>
         <p>
           In addition to software projects, I have worked on several projects such as a microcontroller powered prosthesis arm and a full sized racing simulator for the University of Melbourne's FSAE team. 
         </p>
         <p>
           Apart from engineering, I am fascinated about game theory and competition in economics as well as algorithmic trading.
